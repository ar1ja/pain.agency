        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <p>
            I'm not huge on rules. However people do exist and common common-sense
            is not common. Below is a list of guidelines I feel are a reasonable
            expectation of participation. The strict rules are for
            <a href="/legal/tos">pain.agency/legal/tos</a>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Be considerate</b>: Words can hurt. Emotions are real.
                Don't have your head so far up your ass you forget other people
                exist.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Respect boundaries</b>: If someone draws a line in the sand 
                stay on your side, dipshit.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Be ethical</b>: Sure we do a little trolling. Keep it cute. 
                Keep it clean. A harmless joke is funny. Ruining someones life
                isn't.
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Keep it above the belt</b>: Don't insult people for things that they
                cant change. Be mature and realize that it doesn't kill you to respect
                pronouns. 
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            Blah Blah, muh free speech. This is my space, I run it how I like. If 
            you're being a piece of shit, youre not welcome here. Go host your own
            server if you care so much. Free speech is
            the right to speak freely, not the right to have someone hold a
            space for you to be heard.
