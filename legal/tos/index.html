        <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>

        <p>
            Rules suck, but getting taken offline sucks even more. Here you
            will find some no-nonsense rules that are pretty easy to not break. 
            Do note that for practical reasons we reserve the right to revoke 
            your accout for reasons not listed here, however we try to not 
            make a habit of this. Where applicable we will comply with our
            duty as a platform to report law violating users to
            the appropriate authorities.
